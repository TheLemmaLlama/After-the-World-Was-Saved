old life:
- happy and free
- free but happier now (with material standards)
- unhappy and oppressed
- oppressed but less happy now (out of loyalty to their clan/legacy?)

origins:
- local barbarian tribe (from long ago?)
- barbarian tribe from thevery hot north connected to chea via ancient ports (teleporters)
- destitute
- child of debtor






plots:
- child of debtor who's still alive has been enslaved rather than their parent, which many agree is unfair ... naturally the parent should be the one enslaved instead since they made the promise (the protags 'intellectually agree' with this but can't help but feel uneasy about it)
- slave runs away because they actually feel bad about taken care of wrt food/lodging/etc when they feel like they're not doing a good enough job for it to be worth it to their master, who's only keeping them around out of pity/obligation (maybe they're a sex slave, whose only job is to make love to their master unlike the hard manual/etc labour their fellow slaves do?)(ainslie: wow, you really feel bad about that? it might not seem like you're doing much, but it's a big sacrifice! I'd *rather* haul around rocks all day than let someone touch my privates whenever they want)[ofc a lot of slaves are expected to do both sexual and other (physical/intellectual/emotional/etc) labour](maybe they go back to their master, who exploits their feelings of unworthiness to have them start doing physical labour as well as sexual? prob physical labour that keeps their body delicate-looking though)
- a barbarian 'tribe' remains unconquered and is widely known to harbour mystical powers; in truth, they're being protected by the phygists, who want to see if they can introduce them to civilization by talking to them and giving them tech for them to do with as they will, rather than forcibly assimilating them. (they're disappointed they cling onto their silly traditions and superstitions [perhaps rejecting some of the tech and culture as evil/'demonic'?], but mainstream culture is just as bad with their silly traditions and superstitions so that's no reason to let them be abducted and assimilated instead)
