- manipulation as withholding info
- but there is necessarily an order in which we communicate info. does that mean we must always lead with the worst things about ourselves to avoid subjecting others to the halo effect?
- plus there is limits to information transfer. people may not have enough time and attention to devote to learning all relevant info about you
- manipulation as knowing; non-manipulation as embracing ignorance
- manipulation as restriction of options; it's okay to deliver information in an order that risks the halo effect, as people will still *have* that information and use it to consider options. the halo effect isn't that blinding in the face of info; people aren't that impressionable, they're not slaves to their feelings, they can put them aside and think for themselves
- as for people having limited time/attention to receive that info; there is indeed not much we can do about that, but we can still say for sure it's manipulative to withhold obviously relevant info when the other person definitely *does* have the time to listen
