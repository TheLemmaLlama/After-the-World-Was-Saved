- transhumanism/altering nature bad
- vindictive female/'crazy (ex)girlfriend' plot
- ungrateful child
- cycle of abuse
[
abused snaps and lashes out (perhaps even at someone innocent/powerless/'undeserving'), then fears they're becoming abusive, but the narrative portrays their one-time lapse as different from an abuser's continuous mistreatment?

adapt:
- gillis' parable about 'why we'll always need trade' (but with fear of markets replaces by fear of knowing people/'coldly calculating'/etc, a la 'manipulation as withholding'?)(cleria then takes the opposite tack of knowing *and* manipulating people anyway; both are trapped in the assumption that knowledge implies manipulation)
- gillis' story about 'patriarchy in the scene' and the abuse story leading up to it??
- rygier's story in 'from stirner to mussolini'?? (maybe these anarchist scene stories (esp. involving sniching etc) cound be applied to groups like the gaosian thieves guild?)
