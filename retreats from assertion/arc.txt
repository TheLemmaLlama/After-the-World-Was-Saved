* tolerance
* pluralism
* 'believe what you like, just don't act on them to hurt people'



- retreat to 'personal preference'
* i personally find this distasteful, not saying it's universally wrong
* i'm just like this (by nature); didn't choose to be like this because i have a moral belief that it's justified
