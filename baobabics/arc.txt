- cleria organizes to strike a deal to leave them alone, appealing to roda and his desire to live long enough to see interesting stuff happen (gaos is closest neighbour to topia and roda is respected like a god there)(cleria being last survivng menber of topian royal family carries clout? though it makes her enemies of former topian nobles?)
- something about nationalism/indigeneity and the baobabic refugees being colonists?







names for topia after baobabic settlement:
- new topia?
- [something something] autonomous zone?
