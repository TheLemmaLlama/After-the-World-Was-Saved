- sigma isn't a conventionally tough guy, being quite openly emotional, but is usually respected as a man anyway - and not just because he's a prince
- acting like an oblivious airhead is itself a kind of 'hardness', a way to project invulnerability/inviolability/a 'you can't hurt me' aura. he gives no reaction to insults and the like by pretending to read it as something else [praise, good-faith criticism, neutral opinion etc]. if people try to physically hurt him, he takes steps to prevent that without taking offense, as if the offender is just a random force of nature (e.g. if someone tripped him with their foot, he'd react as if the person was just a rock that can be influenced by persuasion/threats/etc)
- he used to be more serious as a child, but also easily offended, which made him a target just like someone with a more stereotypically 'weak' (gentle, etc) personality. so he found being serious and 'dry'[choleric/melancholic] was not really a way to be invulnerable
